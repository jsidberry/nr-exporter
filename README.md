# [Export/Backup New Relic APM Metrics Using The NerdGraph GraphQL API](https://www.qloudx.com/export-backup-new-relic-apm-metrics-using-the-nerdgraph-graphql-api/)

## Some initial steps after cloning the code
Add the python module named `license` to the root directory of code.
```
touch license.py
```
inside that `license.py` file, place the your content to match your environment; this is an example/template to follow:
```
user_key = '550d...NRAL'
```
The code will need the value of the `user_key` variable throughout the code.
